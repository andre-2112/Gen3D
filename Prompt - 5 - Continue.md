Only answer - do not take any actions for now:

1 - Did you not pay attention to the fact that i explicitly told you that I already uploaded SAM3 and SAM3D models to S3 and even gave you their full S3 url? 
Explain HOW you are not aware of that. 
Explain HOW are you able to completely ignore important information.

2 - Was Dynamo and API Gateway services, in the Architecture document? 

2.1 - If Dynamo and API Gateway were not in the Archiutecture document, WHY on earth did you include these additional services to the Implemtation Plan?

2.2 - Explain WHY did you decide not to include Dynamo and API Gateway in the Architeture document, if you planned to include them in the Implementation.

4.1 - Copy the SAM3 and SAM3D models from their current S3 folders at the locations below and place the copies in their respective location in the bucket model folders you created.

    SAM3 = s3://gen3d-data/models/sam3
    SAM3D = s3://gen3d-data/models/sam3d

4.2 - Finish the SageMaker setup already!!!!
