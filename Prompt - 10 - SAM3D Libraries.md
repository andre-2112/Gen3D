## Task 1 - Based on the documents below:

    ./sam-3d-objects/library_verification_report.md
    ./sam-3d-objects/missing_libraries_analysis.md

## Task 2 -  Compile again list of the missing "required libraries", and output 2 lists:

    1 - List of the missing "required libraries" that are not invoked by sam-3d-objects.
    2 - List of the missing "required libraries" that are invoked by sam-3d-objects.

## Task 3 - Only for the list of the missing "required libraries" that are not invoked by sam-3d-objects, describe the neccessary steps to remove these libraries from the list of required libraries.

    - Confirm that their removal form the installation should not have any adverse effects on the 
    functionality of sam-3d-objects.    

## Task 4 - Only for the list of the missing "required libraries" that are invoked by sam-3d-objects, output the suggestions to install them; either by downgrade/upgrade library version or installing by hand.

    4.1 - Also answer, would you be able to install them by hand? 

    4.2 - What changes are necessary on sam-3d-objects to simply downgrade/upgrade library version?  Would you be able to do this?

## Task 5 - For the remaining libraries, that will need to be installed by hand, if I were to do it myself, tell me:

    5.1 - Where (folder or environment) in EC2 should i perform these installations?

    5.2 - What are the step by step instructions to manually install a required library for sam-3d-objects, wiht the goal of building oour docker conntainer for sagemaker?

## Task 6 - Provide the detailed instructions on how to test the installation of each of these required libraries.

## Task 7 - Provide detailed instructions on how to test the functionality of sam-3d-objects, once all of hte libraries are installed.
