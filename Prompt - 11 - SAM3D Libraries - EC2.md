# Tasks

## Task 1 - Understand previous requests:

    <request_1>
        Read the document from this url: https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam-3d-objects/blob/main/requirements.txt . For each required library, verify that is possible to 1) download the library, 2) install the library successfully wiht no errors, 3) test the library installation (with a simple import and invocation). Generate a complete report and save it to a new markdown document.
    </request_1>

    <request_2>
        Can you read the code for sam3d package and investigate where functions from the missing libraries are invoked - and compile a list of these invocations to help determine if its possible to generate the code for the functions of the missing libraries. for each of the missing libraries, provide a link to their download website or source code repository, if available.
    </request_2>

    - Understand that the 2 previous requests above were supposed to have been executed in our EC2 instance, not the local Windows machine.

## Task 2 - Re-execute both requests from the Task #1 above, but this time in the EC2 instance we have on AWS (genesis3d).

    - Provide 2 new documents (v2) with the results of the requests above. 

## Task 3 - AFTER Task #2 is completed, read again the file below and answer all its questions, but time, based on the the EC2 instance.

    <file>
        "./Prompt - 10 - SAM3D Libraries.md"
    </file>

    - Generate a new markdown document with the answers to all the questions.
