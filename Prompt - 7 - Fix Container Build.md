0 - so you launched 3 ec2 insances so far, when only 1 was needed? poor planning or what?

1 - so on your new plan , you will reuse or thrown away the models you downloaded form s3 to the ec2 instance?

2 - how many ec2 instances will you need to get this right? idiot!!!

2 - How many times you have to try and how many hours of my time will you waste?

3 - why doon't you plan well ahead of time?

4 - make a plan for the build of this container - taking into consideration: a) the long time it takes to copy the models from s3 to s3 (should it really take so long?) ; b) the long time it takes for the container image to be built; 3) any and all constrains with comands and other recurring issues.

5 - present this plan so i can review it first - and make sure you get this plan right!!!

6 - what is hte point of making a plan if it doesnt execute as expected.
